            <h2 class="is-underlined">Why Perspectives?</h2>
            <p>God has a "world-sized" role for every Christian in His global purpose. Whether people go to distant countries or stay at home is a secondary issue. The primary issue is what most people are hungry to discover: vision to live a life of purpose.
              Discovering that vision makes this course valuable, and perhaps crucial, for any Christian.
            </p>
            <h2 class="is-underlined">What is Perspectives?</h2>
            <p>Perspectives is a fifteen week course designed around four vantage points or "perspectives" â€” Biblical, Historical, Cultural and Strategic. Each one highlights different aspects of God's global purpose.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Biblical</strong> and <strong>Historical</strong> sections reveal why our confidence is based on the historic fact of God's relentless work from the dawn of history until this day.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Cultural</strong> and <strong>Strategic</strong> sections underscore that we are in the midst of a costly, but very "do-able" task, confirming the Biblical and Historical hope.</p>
